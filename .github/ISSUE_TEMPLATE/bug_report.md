REMEMBER, YOU ARE TALKING TO HUMAN BEINGS!

AzuraCast is not a big corporate entity. We are a small independent project run by a tiny team of
core developers and maintainers. We accept donations, but these donations are not very substantial.
We aim to help as many people as we can, but we can't always respond as quickly as you might like.

Please be kind and patient in your interactions with us. Thank you in advance.
